                <h3>Experience</h3>
                <p><strong>Researcher</strong><br> <strong>University of New Hampshire, 2018 - Present </strong></p>
				<p> I developed and maintained robust data pipelines that processed and cleaned large datasets from various 
				scientific satellite missions, ensuring data integrity and quality. I also performed exploratory data analysis (EDAs)
				and feature engineering to extract actionable insights from complex satellite datasets. Based on the EDAs, I designed and implemented
				advanced multivariate analysis techniques to explore magnetometer station data, leading to the creation of
				comprehensive network graphs. I applied cutting-edge statistical modeling and deep learning algorithms to predict 
				global temperature variations, resulting in highly accurate forecasting models. Compared the accuracy of temperature 
				based CNN models with a control model by conducting A/B testing  to ensure robustness and accuracy of predictive models. I collaborated with interdisciplinary teams, 
				including scientists, engineers, and product managers, to optimize data processing workflows.</p>
				
                <p><strong>Intern</strong><br><strong>Center for Integrated Space Weather Modeling, Summer 2019</strong></p>
				<p> During my internship, I analyzed space weather data to assess its impact on critical infrastructure, leading to actionable insights and preventive measures. 
				I utilized advanced statistical models to predict and mitigate telecommunication disruptions, enhancing the reliability of
				communication networks during space weather events. I also collaborated with interdisciplinary teams to evaluate the effects of space weather
				on various sectors, from aviations to transportation etc., and communicated my findings through detailed dashboards.</p>
				
				<p><strong>Researcher</strong><br><strong>New Jersey Institute of Technology, 2015 - 2018</strong></p>
				<p>During my time at NJIT, I employed advanced data analysis techniques to investigate ultra-low frequency waves in space. I conducted multivariate statistical 
				analysis and applied machine learning algorithms for data interpolation, enhancing data accuracy. Additionally, I developed data visualization tools to effectively 
				present complex research findings to both technical and non-technical stakeholders.</p>
